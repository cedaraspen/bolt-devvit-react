Build Devvit apps using Bolt and React!

- [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/): A way to build and deploy immersive games on Reddit
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/): For compiling the webView

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. Sign up for Reddit
2. Create a playtest subreddit for your app. (e.g. r/mygametest). You can find this in your left sidebar on Reddit.com, under communities.

After you've done this, you're ready to start building in Bolt.
